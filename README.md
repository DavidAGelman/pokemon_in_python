# pokemon_in_python
The purpose of this project is to use base python 3 functionality to gain familiarty with how lists and dictionaries function.  The end deliverable is a function that takes a csv file and converts it into a dictionary.

The jupyter notebook contains project objectives and the python code to complete them.  The file 'pokedex_basic.csv' is required to complete the project.

The project is great practice for creating and appending python dictionaries as well as acessing nested dictionaries.  There is also an emphasis on creating and applying functions to nested dictionaries using both dictionary comprehensions and `for` loops.  Another key element of the project is reading in a csv file, parsing it out, and then extracting information from the resulting list of lists.
